# Run Log

## 2026-08-29 — Track initialization

- Confirmed the repository root at
  `/Volumes/PortableSSD/GitHub/archive-govt-nz` and preserved a clean worktree
  on local `main`, which was 17 commits ahead of `origin/main` before this
  scaffold.
- Read the project definition, requirements, design, technology stack,
  workflow, autonomy policy, tracks registry and applicable repository rules.
- Ran `./scripts/validate.sh` before scaffolding. The full local baseline
  passed: lock, formatting, lint, strict typing, 1,161 tests with 95.36%
  coverage, schemas, parity, mutation lanes, hygiene, CAS benchmark,
  dependency audit, licence checks, secret scan and SBOM validation.
- The validation harness updated four timestamp-bearing evidence receipts.
  Their diffs were inspected and restored as known generated churn; no
  substantive evidence change was retained.
- Cloned the public donor read-only and pinned commit
  `4668e6c3b1b492086941d4c1ef96e299250a8301`, tree
  `c6d44ff79eda73cfc6ba7db5764e27ce01b890e1`, and deterministic Git archive
  SHA-256
  `9c8ab0feaa752ead08163463a634623d55a62a69608772b73127b3d7b709157e`.
- Verified the donor inventory contains 23 tracked files (6,604,301 bytes):
  eight original source files, one five-table/312-row SQLite database, three
  Python scripts, six PNG plots, and five documentation/licence files.
- `python -m py_compile process_data.py` identified an `IndentationError` in
  the donor. This is characterization evidence and a regression target; donor
  code was not executed as trusted production code.
- Inspected the current Hugging Face HEOR collection read-only. It exists and
  was public; only `edithatogo/reimbursement-atlas` was observed as a member.
  No health-appropriations dataset was created or uploaded.
- The spreadsheet capability lookup reported that bundled workspace workbook
  dependencies were not configured. No alternate parser was silently used;
  executable workbook inventory and dependency evaluation are explicit Phase
  1 tasks.
- Reviewed official discovery leads for Treasury/Budget Vote Health and fiscal
  series, Ministry of Health Vote Health series, Pharmac CPB, and Stats NZ
  context. These remain planning observations pending a live cutoff-bound
  source census and resource-level rights evidence.
- User explicitly approved the revised medallion-aligned specification and
  plan, including complete original retention and the direct/indirect dataset
  recommendations.

## Initialization boundary

No source payload was copied into this repository, no archive CAS was mutated,
no new dependency was adopted, no external issue was created, and no GitHub or
Hugging Face publication state was changed during planning.

## 2026-08-29 — Post-scaffold validation

- Track structural checks passed: all 19 Must requirements and all 16
  acceptance criteria appear in the plan; all ten required artifacts exist;
  metadata and four JSONL evidence records parse; the registry link resolves;
  and `conductor/index.md` is unchanged.
- `./scripts/validate.sh` passed after the scaffold: lock, Ruff format/lint,
  basedpyright, 1,161 randomized tests in 190.84 seconds, 95.36% coverage, 30
  schemas and 20 representative documents, 9/9 parity checks, every targeted
  mutation lane, zero hygiene findings, 590.54 MB/s CAS benchmark, no known
  dependency vulnerabilities, licence inventory, source-scoped secret scan,
  and a validated 102-component CycloneDX SBOM.
- Four harness-generated timestamp-only evidence diffs were inspected and
  restored. They were unrelated to this planning track and are not included in
  its change set.
- The first staged-source scan failed closed on one unverified keyword finding:
  a machine-evidence key named `secret_scan`. Inspection of the bounded receipt
  confirmed that no token or credential was present. The field was renamed to
  `tracked_source_scan`; no detector suppression was added, and the staged
  source scan then passed with zero candidates.
